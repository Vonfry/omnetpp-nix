* OMNeT++ Nix

Build OMNeT++ with Nix.

Note: WIP, here are some problem to run. Now I try to use it with nix-shell
build it for each projects with source files.

** Install

*** From Src
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone http://gitlab.com/Vonfry/omnetpp-nix
nix-build
#+END_SRC

*** nix-env

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
nix-env -i omnetpp-<version> -f https://gitlab.com/Vonfry/omnetpp-nix/tree/master/
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Of course, you can use this project as your projects' dependency, which is
recommended a lot instead of instealling it.

Here are some arguments in [[file:default.nix][default.nix]]. Please check them, and use ~callPackage~
to customize. For example, you may want to override python3 with other
packages which you need.
