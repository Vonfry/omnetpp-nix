* OMNeT++ Nix

  Build OMNeT++ with Nix.

  Note: WIP, here are some problem to run. Now I try to use it with nix-shell
  build it for each projects with source files.

** Usage

   The [[file:./default.nix][default.nix]] is a packed of omnetpp with IDE. But
   this file is a function instead of a drv directly.

   The [[file:./pkgs.nix][pkgs.nix]] is a collection of drvs in this repo. It
   imports `<nixpkgs>` by default. So you can use it simply by nix-env or
   nixpkgs.fetchers with this repo's url.

** Package List
   - [[file:default.nix][omnetpp]]
       + [[file:osgearth.nix][osgearth]]
       + akaroa - not free, so it is not packed by default.
   - [[file:inet.nix][INET]] - [[https://inet.omnetpp.org/][website]]
   - [[file:keetchi.nix][keetchi]] - [[https://github.com/ComNets-Bremen/KeetchiLib][repo]]
   - [[file:ops.nix][OPS]] - [[https://github.com/ComNets-Bremen/OPS][repo]]
